    <h3 class="">What is Event Loop In JS?</h3>
    <p>The event loop in JavaScript is a process that constantly
        checks for pending tasks or events.
        It executes the associated code for those tasks in an order
        that ensures efficient handling of asynchronous operations
        without blocking the main program execution.</p>
    <p><b>Call Stack:</b>
        The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of function
        calls during program execution. It follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle,
        meaning that the last function pushed onto the stack is the first one to be popped off and executed. Whenever a
        function is called, it is added to the top of the call stack,
        and when a function completes, it is removed from the stack.</p>

        <p><b>Event Queue:</b>
        The event queue is a data structure that holds events and their associated callback functions.
        When an event occurs, its corresponding callback function is added to the event queue.
        The event queue follows a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) order,
        meaning that the first event added is the first one to be processed.
        </p>
        <p><b>Event Loop:</b>
            The event loop is a continuous process
            that manages the execution of code in an asynchronous and non-blocking manner.
            It constantly checks the call stack and the event queue,
            ensuring that the call stack is empty before taking events from the queue
            and executing their associated callback functions.</p>

        <script>
            // First Expriment
            console.log("Experiment 1")
            console.log("Start");
            setTimeout(() => {
                console.log("Center")
            });
            console.log("End");
            /* OutPut:
             Start
             End
             Center        
            Conclusion:
            Set Timeout is non-blocking and take some milisecond to 
            excut, and else code excute without any distrubance. 
            Therefor it excute in this in the end of first console
            and second console */

            // Second Expriment
            console.log("Experiment 2");

                console.log("Center")

             Start
             End
             Center        
            Conclusion:
            Reasulth are similar to first expriment..
