    <h3>What is Apply , Call, and Bind in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>apply, bind, and call are methods in JavaScript that allow you to control how functions are called and set the this value inside the function.
        apply and call are used to invoke a function immediately, while bind returns a new function that can be called later.
        They help you customize the context (the value of this) and pass arguments to functions in a flexible manner.
        Use apply when passing an array of arguments, call when passing arguments individually, and bind when creating a new function with preset values.
        Overall, these methods give you more control over function execution, enabling you to work with different object contexts and arguments conveniently.</p>
