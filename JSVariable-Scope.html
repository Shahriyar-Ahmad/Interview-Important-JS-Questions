</head>

<body>
    <h3>What is Deference between let,const, and var?</h3>
    <p>They all are keywords that are use in JS to start a variable, they all use to
        declare a varible , but have some deferences that we explore now...</p>
    <b>var:</b>
    <p>Var is most knowing keyword to declare a variable in js and many other language. It become less using after
        comming his alternate like let, const in js. It has globle and funcitonal scope. It can be reasign and
        redeclare.</p>
    <b>let:</b>
    <p>Let is most common use keyword to use declare a variable after ECMA7. It is block scope varible , we can reasign
        this in their scope but not redeclare.</p>
    </p>
    <b>Const:</b>
    <p>Const is third keyword for declaring a variable in js , it is also block scope like let but it we cannot reasign
        and redeclare in their scope.</p>
    <h3>What is Scope in JS and How many types?</h3>
    <p>Scope mean in js an area or space where you can access a variable and Js have three types of Scope that are <li>
            Global Scope</li>
        <li>Functional Scope</li>
        <li>Block Scope</li>
    </p>
    <b>Global Scope:</b>
    <p>Global scope mean in js when you declare a variable out of functons and blocks than you can access the
        variable all of the file , from any funciton and block.
    </p>
    <b>Functional Scope:</b>
    <p>Its mean when you declare a variable in funciton, then you can access the variable from
        any place of that funciton, it is called funcitonal scope.
    </p>
    <b>Block Scope:</b>
    <p>Block scope mean in js declare a variable in block like {} if, for then you cannot access
        the variable out of these block, it is called block scope.
    </p>
    <script>
        // var example
        function example() {
            var x = 10;
            if (true) {
                var x = 20; // Redeclaration and reassignment of 'x'
                console.log(x); // Output: 20
            }
            console.log(x); // Output: 20
        }
        // let example
        function example() {
            let x = 10;
            if (true) {
                let x = 20; // New block scope variable 'x'
                console.log(x); // Output: 20
            }
            console.log(x); // Output: 10 (outer block scope variable)
        }
        // const example
        function example() {
            const x = 10;
            if (true) {
                const x = 20; // New block scope constant 'x'
                console.log(x); // Output: 20
            }
            console.log(x); // Output: 10 (outer block scope constant)
        }
