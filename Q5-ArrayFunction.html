    <h3>What is Map, Filter, and Reduce Function?</h3>
    <p><b>Map:</b>map:

        Imagine you have a list of items (an array), and you want to transform each item into something else.
        With map, you can define a function that specifies how each item should be transformed.
        The map method applies this function to every item in the array, creating a new array with the transformed
        values.
        Think of it like taking a list of ingredients and using a recipe to convert each ingredient into a different
        form or state.</p>
    <p><b>Filter:</b>Imagine you have a list of items (an array), and you want to select only certain items based on a
        condition.
        With filter, you can define a function that checks if an item meets the specified condition.
        The filter method applies this function to each item in the array and creates a new array containing only the
        items that pass the condition.
        It's like using a filter to separate the items you want to keep from the ones you want to discard.</p>
    <p><b>Reduce:</b>Imagine you have a list of items (an array), and you want to combine them into a single value.
        With reduce, you can define a function that specifies how the values should be combined or accumulated.
        The reduce method applies this function to each item in the array, keeping track of an accumulator that holds
        the intermediate result.
        It's like having a running total or a summary that you update with each item, ultimately resulting in a single
        value.</p>
    <script>
        // map example
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        const doubled = numbers.map((num) => num * 2);
        console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
        // filter example
        const numbers1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        const evenNumbers = numbers1.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);
        console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]
        // reduce example
        const numbers2 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        const sum = numbers2.reduce((accumulator, num) => accumulator + num, 0);
        console.log(sum); // Output: 10
