    <h3>Where JS External File Should Place and Why?</h3>
    <p>External JavaScript files are typically placed just before the closing body tag. 
        This allows faster page loading, avoids blocking rendering, ensures DOM availability,
         and separates content from behavior for better code organization and maintainability.</p>
         <h3>When JS External File Should Place in Head Tag?</h3>
         <p>JavaScript external files can be placed in the head tag when critical scripts need 
            to be loaded and executed before rendering the page.</p>
            <h3>What is difference between async and differ in JS</h3>
            <p>async and defer are attributes used when including external 
                JavaScript files in HTML. async allows immediate execution while the document is still parsing, 
                and defer defers execution until after the parsing is complete.</p>
        <h3>How JS Work?</h3>
        <p>JavaScript works by executing code line by line, manipulating the DOM, 
            responding to events, performing asynchronous operations, 
            and enabling interactive and dynamic behavior on web pages.</p>
            <h3>What is Critical Rendering path in JS ?</h3>
            <p>The critical rendering path is the process of rendering and displaying 
                the initial content of a web page as quickly as possible.</p>
