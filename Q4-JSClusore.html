    <h3>What is Clusore in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>A closure is like a backpack that a function carries with it, 
        containing all the variables it needs from its outer environment.
         It allows the function to access and use those variables, even
          if the outer function has completed. </p>
          <b>What is Lexical Scope?</b>
          <p>Lexical scope refers to how variables are defined and accessed based on their position in the source code, providing a set of rules for variable visibility and accessibility.</p>
    <script>
        function outer() {
            let outerVar = 10;

            function inner() {
                console.log(outerVar); // Accessing outerVar from the outer scope
            }

            return inner;
        }

        const closureFunc = outer(); // The outer function has finished executing, but closureFunc still has access to outerVar
        closureFunc(); // Output: 10

    </script>
